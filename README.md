inpress
===

inpress is a WordPress theme based on _s, with inspration from Bones and other places.

Unlike many themes, inpress is designed with developers and one-off projects in mind. inpress uses Bulma, but tries not to be largely framework agnostic. It should be easy to fork and customise.

Detailed documentation will be available on Github: https://github.com/justliam/inpress/wiki
